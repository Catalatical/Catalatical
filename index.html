    <p>
    I had an Student Internship at Team Neusta, a company that provides IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies, i will tell you more about it in a different chapter
    <br>
    In this Internship there were 2 divisions, either you could join the Graphics department, or the Software department.
    <br>
    I was in the Software department because well, I was interested in programming.

    <p class="style-gradient">
      So, some know that i am interested in computer science and development, but i havent really used any serious programming languages.<br>
      I have only used Scratch, LUA and Unreal Engine 5's blueprints to make some tiny games or projects.
      nothing too serious. I also draw but thats irrevelant.
      <br>
      Ive been wanting to learn a real programming language for a long time and just didnt find a time to do so.<br><br>
      and when we were supposed to apply for an internship, my first thought was mediamarkt, which was a really bad idea.
      thanks to someone who I know from russian class, who told me about this company
      and I immediately applied for it, and they accepted me quite fast.
      <br>
      <br>
      I was quite glad that i got a spot there, the last one even. 
      I just didnt know how big the company was.

      <h2>Day 1 // Introduction</h2>
            <p>it was a good day, we all (4) interns had sat in the lobby for about 5 minutes until our supervisor came to greet us, she started with a tour, that showed like how to navigate in here
            , we didnt do anything really significant except use lego brainstorm and the additional software to make some kind of mech that moved and to finish its goal, which was a simple obstacle.
            </p>
    </div>

    <div id="day2" class="day">
      <h2>Day 2 // Testing</h2>
            <p>in this day, i reprogrammed the mech to do silly things like get aggressive and spin or make it ask simple math questions, the day was not that
            interesting.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="day3" class="day">
      <h2>Day 3 // HTML & CSS</h2>
            <p>that day the original supervisor was sick and we had a new one, and we learnt about HTML, using a website called w3schools.com, very useful.
            and since that day i just make projects called "project 1", "project 4" and so on.
            i also learned to use CSS which is a satisfying language that makes out the design, while html makes out the structure.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="day4" class="day">
      <h2>Day 4 // wasnt there</h2>
    </div>

    <div id="day5" class="day">
      <h2>Day 5 // Tour</h2>
            <p>that day we were just learning and testing html and css, we did not do anything significant until the supervisor guided us around the company with more details, and i did learn more things
            like how team neusta is split into divisions like "Software development", "Mobile Solutions", "HEC" and so on, pretty interesting.</p>
