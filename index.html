    <h1>"The Time Before"</h1>
    <p>
      So, some know that i am interested in computer science and development, but i havent really used any serious programming languages.<br>
      I have only used Scratch, LUA and Unreal Engine 5's blueprints to make some tiny games or projects.
      nothing too serious. I also draw but thats irrevelant.
      <br>
      Ive been wanting to learn a real programming language for a long time and just didnt find a time to do so.<br><br>
      and when we were supposed to apply for an internship, my first thought was mediamarkt, which was a really bad idea.
      thanks to someone who I know from russian class, who told me about this company
      and I immediately applied for it, and they accepted me quite fast.
      <br>
      <br>
      I was quite glad that i got a spot there, the last one even. 
      I just didnt know how big the company was.
