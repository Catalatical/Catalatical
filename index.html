  <h1>Student Internship at Team Neusta</h1>
  <p>
  I had an Student Internship at Team Neusta, a company that provides IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies, i will tell you more about it in a different chapter
  <br>
  In this Internship there were 2 divisions, either you could join the Graphics department, or the Software department.
  <br>
  I was in the Software department because well, I was interested in programming.

  <h1 class="style-title">"The Time Before"</h1>
  <p class="style-gradient">
    So, some know that i am interested in computer science and development, but i havent really used any serious programming languages.<br>
    I have only used <a class="style-mark">Scratch</a>, LUA and Unreal Engine 5's blueprints to make some tiny games or projects.
    nothing too serious. I also draw but thats irrevelant.
    <br>
    Ive been wanting to learn a real programming language for a long time and just didnt find a time to do so.<br><br>
    and when we were supposed to apply for an internship, my first thought was mediamarkt, which was a really bad idea.
    thanks to someone who I know from russian class, who told me about this company
    and I immediately applied for it, and they accepted me quite fast.
    <br>
    <br>
    I was quite glad that i got a spot there, the last one even. 
    I just didnt know how big the company was.

          <h2>Day 1 // Introduction</h2>
          <p>it was a good day, we all (4) interns had sat in the lobby for about 5 minutes until our supervisor came to greet us, she started with a tour, that showed like how to navigate in here
          , we didnt do anything really significant except use lego brainstorm and the additional software to make some kind of mech that moved and to finish its goal, which was a simple obstacle.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="day2" class="day">
          <h2>Day 2 // Testing</h2>
          <p>in this day, i reprogrammed the mech to do silly things like get aggressive and spin or make it ask simple math questions, the day was not that
          interesting.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="day3" class="day">
          <h2>Day 3 // HTML & CSS</h2>
          <p>that day the original supervisor was sick and we had a new one, and we learnt about HTML, using a website called w3schools.com, very useful.
          and since that day i just make projects called "project 1", "project 4" and so on.
          i also learned to use CSS which is a satisfying language that makes out the design, while html makes out the structure.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="day4" class="day">
          <h2>Day 4 // wasnt there</h2>
          <p>:(</p>
        </div>

        <div id="day5" class="day">
          <h2>Day 5 // Tour</h2>
          <p>that day we were just learning and testing html and css, we did not do anything significant until the supervisor guided us around the company with more details, and i did learn more things
          like how team neusta is split into divisions like "Software development", "Mobile Solutions", "HEC" and so on, pretty interesting.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="day6" class="day">
          <h2>Day 6 // PHP  </h2>
          <p>at that time i knew html and css pretty well, javascript and php, not so much, so i started learning php and javascript,
          i dont really like php, but it was interesting to learn and isnt bad at all.
        </div>

        <div id="day7" class="day">
          <h2>Day 7 // wasnt there</h2>
          <p>>:(</p>
        </div>

        <div id="day8" class="day">
          <h2>Day 8 // Group project</h2>
          <p>in this day, thorben, andreas, and I were in a group and worked towards making a website, we didnt really have an idea so we just made a basic log in website that
          later turned into a joke website, i was in charge of front-end programming and the others were in charge of back-end programming.
          we didnt really get anywhere with this project.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="day9" class="day">
          <h2>Day 9 // Surprise guests</h2>
          <p>the day was normal, we continued the project until we had surprise guests that told us about the company more detailed, how it operates, what the divisions do and how programmers are split, back-end and front-end and so on.
          they also gave us a kahoot quiz containing questions such as those, it was moderately fun and interesting.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="day10" class="day">
          <h2>Day 10 // boring day</h2>
          <p>we just continued the project and i created project 6, aka this website, nothing much except toying around...</p>
        </div>

        <div id="day11" class="day">
          <h2>Day 11 // Attempts</h2>
          <p>this day i just spent time upgrading project 6, and then after some time, i was getting bored so i decided to try out C++..
          i couldnt due to lack of permission, so i tried pygame, a library for python made for games, i did not understand alot of things, soooo, that was an attempt.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="day12" class="day">
          <h2>Day 12 // C++</h2>
          <p>I tried learning C++ from that day on, safe to say C++ is not that easy to learn, its like, the most effecient coding language but it has really strict syntax.
          and also my class teacher has visited my workspace and well, safe to say coding is proooobably something for me.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="day13" class="day">
          <h2>Day 13 // C++?</h2>
          <p>C++ is [REDACTED] mind melting. I make 3D models and games, but C++ just confuses me, and im not sure why</p>
        </div>

        <div id="day14" class="day">
          <h2>Day 14 // C++.</h2>
          <p>yeah i sorta just spent the whole day learning C++, itll take a while until i can really use it freely, its not that easy.
          compared to html and css, it is quite hard, but you should keep in mind html is a mark up language and css just defines variables.
          i cant find things to make with C++, its not supposed to be made for creativity, its simply made for effeciency.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="day15" class="day">
          <h2>Day 15 // Final Day</h2>
          <p></p>
